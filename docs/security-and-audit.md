# Security & audit model (high level)

ToxMCP modules aim to be:

- **Guardrailed**: explicit tool schemas, validation, and policy hooks.
- **Auditable**: provenance and structured outputs designed for traceability.

Because modules integrate with third-party services and, in some cases, proprietary software, always review each module’s configuration and access requirements.
