# Contributing to ToxMCP

Thanks for your interest in contributing.

## Where to start

- If you found a bug or want a feature: open an issue in the relevant module repo.
- If you’re unsure which repo: start with the umbrella repo issues: https://github.com/ToxMCP/toxmcp/issues

## Expectations

- Keep changes focused and well-scoped.
- Add or update documentation when behavior/config changes.
- Prefer small PRs that are easy to review.

## Development basics

Each module repo contains its own dev setup (Python version, package manager, and run commands).
Please follow the module README and keep secrets out of git.

## Security

If you believe you’ve found a security issue, please follow the SECURITY.md in the relevant module repository.
